# Pressure Groups
> A Pressure Group is an organization which seeks to influence policy, but does not seek public office itself.

- ##### Pressure groups are defined by three key features:
	1. They seek to exert influence from outside, rather than to win or exercise government power. Pressure groups do not make policy decisions, but rather try to influence those who do. In that sense, they are ‘external’ to government. They can therefore act as a channel of ongoing communication between the people and government between elections.
	2. They typically have a narrow issue focus. In some cases, they may focus on a single issue (for instance, opposing a planned road development) or a narrow cluster of issues (for instance, all issues that affect workers’ rights).
	3. Their members are united by either a shared belief in a particular cause or a common set of interests. People with different ideological and party preferences may thus work happily together as members of the same pressure group.

Pressure groups are categorized in different ways  interest or cause groups and insider or outsider groups.
