# Pressure Groups
> A Pressure Group is an organization which seeks to influence policy, but does not seek public office itself.

- ##### Pressure groups are defined by three key features:
	1. They seek to exert influence from outside, rather than to win or exercise government power. Pressure groups do not make policy decisions, but rather try to influence those who do. In that sense, they are ‘external’ to government. They can therefore act as a channel of ongoing communication between the people and government between elections.
	2. They typically have a narrow issue focus. In some cases, they may focus on a single issue (for instance, opposing a planned road development) or a narrow cluster of issues (for instance, all issues that affect workers’ rights).
	3. Their members are united by either a shared belief in a particular cause or a common set of interests. People with different ideological and party preferences may thus work happily together as members of the same pressure group.

Pressure groups are categorized in different ways  interest or cause groups and insider or outsider groups.

- # Types of Pressure Groups
	- ### Sectional (or Interest) Groups:
		- Try to advance the interests of their members.
		- Clearly defined membership, e.g. trade unions and professional organsiation as the BMA or RMT.
	- ### Cause (or Promotional) Groups:
		- Campaign on issues which are **NOT** related to the economic interests of their members e.g RSPB, Extinction Rebellion
	- ### Insider Groups:
		- Have considerable influence over decision-makers
		- Specialist organisations that offer consultation to the government, e.g CBI or NFU
		- **'Core Insiders'** are consulted regularly and have meaninful impact on policy, e.g. IEA
	- ### Outsider Groups
		- Groups outside of the political loop
		- May have been refused insider status, so 'go public'
		- Some chose to distance themselves from the government for ideological reasons
		- Achieve access and gain government attention through other means (winning public support).

- # Further aspects of Pressure Groups
	- Usually have a limited or specific set of aims (e.g. protecting birds, stopping HS2, cutting immigration)
	- Membership is less diverse than for parties (though can be larger)
