- # Types of Pressure Groups
	- ### Sectional (or Interest) Groups:
		- Try to advance the interests of their members.
		- Clearly defined membership, e.g. trade unions and professional organsiation as the BMA or RMT.
	- ### Cause (or Promotional) Groups:
		- Campaign on issues which are **NOT** related to the economic interests of their members e.g RSPB, Extinction Rebellion
	- ### Insider Groups:
		- Have considerable influence over decision-makers
		- Specialist organisations that offer consultation to the government, e.g CBI or NFU
		- **'Core Insiders'** are consulted regularly and have meaninful impact on policy, e.g. IEA
	- ### Outsider Groups
		- Groups outside of the political loop
		- May have been refused insider status, so 'go public'
		- Some chose to distance themselves from the government for ideological reasons
		- Achieve access and gain government attention through other means (winning public support).

- # Further aspects of Pressure Groups
	- Usually have a limited or specific set of aims (e.g. protecting birds, stopping HS2, cutting immigration)
	- Membership is less diverse than for parties (though can be larger)
