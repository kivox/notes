# Devolution
- Devolution is the transfer of power from central government to subordinate regional institutions.
- Differs from Federalism as they have no share in sovereignty
- Their responsibilities and powers are determined by the centre and can in theory be abolished.
- Devolution = "a process, not an event" 
- Students need a greater awareness asymmetrically (unbalanced/lop-sided) nature of devolution.

- ### Devolution
	- Devolution is where central government grants power to subordinate authorities while retaining sovereignty.
	- Thus, it is different from *FEDERALISM*, in which sovereignty is shared between central government and states, and the powers of the latter are guaranteed by the constitution.
	- In its widest sense, devolution can refer to the powers of regional and local government. However, in the UK, it usually refers to powers granted to the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Parliament, and the Northern Ireland Assembly.
	- A level politics concentrates far more on the first two, BUT this doesn't mean that a question won't ask about Northern Ireland.

- ### Is the union secure?
	- **Administrative** devolution has been in place since 1964. Both Scottish and Welsh Offices ran services, allocated funds and administered their country (e.g. the Scottish Office controlled Education, Agriculture, Industry, Environment, Health and Home Affairs in Scotland).
	- **Legislative** devolution (i.e. the power to make, amend and repeal laws in areas determined by Parliament) has only existed since 1997.
	- Devolution in the UK is bound up with the idea of *NATIONALISM*. This is the desire of people with a common bond to unite, usually to have their own government. That bond may be one of language, race, religion, history or geography.
	- The basis of Scottish nationalism is partly geographical, but mainly historical.
	- Scotland had independence until 1707 and was never permanently conquered by the English. The 1707 Act of Union allowed it to retain its own legal and educational system.
	- There is a strong sense of national identity, and the Scottish nationalist party argues for independence within the EU. 
	- The basis of Welsh nationalism is partly geographical, but mainly linguistic (Welsh is widely spoke in rural North West Wales).
	- However, Wales has been ruled by England since Tudor times and is very anglicized, with a similar legal system. South Wales has better communications with England than with mountainous central and north Wales.
	- Hence, Welsh Nationalists are more cautious. Until recently the Welsh Nationalist Party (PLAID CYMRU) argued for self-government rather than full independence
	- It now argues for full independence within the EU in the long run.
	- Northern Ireland's Stormont was set up to ensure unionists and nationalists could share power equally, ending decades of conflict known as the Troubles.
	- It has operated like this since the first election to the devolved assembly took place in 1998.
	- There are 90 seats available in the assembly, the legislative chamber where laws are scrutinized and passed.
	- But forming the government at Stormont which proposes many of the laws is less straightforward.
		- It's a system known as mandatory coalition
		- It means major parties cannot be excluded from government
	- In practice, this sees parties with opposing political stances having to work together on everything from health to infrastructure and education.
	- The lead jobs in the executive - first minister and deputy first minister - are reserved for the largest party from the largest of the unionist/nationalist blocs and the largest party from the second largest of the blocs.
	- Despite their names, the two roles are joint, and one cannot hold office without the other.
		- Since 2003, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had been the largest party in the assembly, followed by nationalists Sinn Féin. May 2022. Sinn Féin became the largest.
	- In February, the DUP withdrew Paul Givan as first minister in opposition of the Northern Ireland Protocol.
	- It meant Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill lost her job as deputy first minister and that the executive could not take decisions because the first and deputy first ministers must chair all meetings.
	- After the assembly election in March 2017, there were three years of stalemate before the executive was re-established.
Power-sharing has collapsed several times, including between 2022 and 2007.
Since devolution in Northern Ireland 22 years ago, Stormont has been without a functioning government for 35% of its lifespan.
