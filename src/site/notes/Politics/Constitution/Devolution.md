# Devolution
- Devolution is the transfer of power from central government to subordinate regional institutions.
- Differs from Federalism as they have no share in sovereignty
- Their responsibilities and powers are determined by the centre and can in theory be abolished.
- Devolution = "a process, not an event" 
- Students need a greater awareness asymmetrically (unbalanced/lop-sided) nature of devolution.
