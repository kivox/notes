- # Constitutional Government
	- Government is conducted within recognized constitutional principles such as the Rule of Law and Parliamentary Sovereignty
	- These are respected and not abused
	- The constitution does not have to be codified

- ### Is the UK system constitutional?
	- Government operates within the law and respects the main principles
		- E.g. regular elections, parliament is sovereign
	- Unwritten conventions are respected
	- Common law and rights are upheld
	- ### The UK system is \*NOT\* Constitutional
		- Rights aren't fully entrenched despite the HR Act as we have no Bill of Rights
		- Prerogative powers of the PM are not limited by law (or are they?) 
		- Recent legislation seems to undermine the Rule of Law, e.g. anti-terrorism laws
	- ### What is an unconstitutional act?
		- If parliament were to attempt to extend its life beyond 5 years
		- If government refused to resign if it lost a vote of no confidence
		- If a minister failed to accept individual ministerial responsibility (e.g. like MicaelHoward who blamed Derek Lewis for prisoner escapes)
