# Arguments For and Against a Codified Constitution

| Against codification | In favour of codification |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Some believe it isn't an issue | Tackle disillusionment with politics |
| Too difficult to change | Developed in a haphazard fashion |
| Uncodified Constitutions are easier to ammend | Better protect individual rights |
|  | There has been a drift to excessive executive power which could be checked by a codified, entrentched constitution |
|  | Eaiser to understand and enforce |
|  | Stops power abuse |
|  | No longer fit for purpose |
|  | Does not conform to the modern democratic world |
|  | Parliament is currently unrestrained |  |
|  | Would clarify the law |
