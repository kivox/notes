| 1215 | Manga Carta - The `Great charter of Freedoms`, imposed by rebelious barons on King John of England. In Manga Carta, the first systematic attempt was made to distinguish between monarchy and tyranny, based on the requirements that the king should rule justly and in accordance with a body of defined law and custom. Among the rights it established was the writ of habeas corpus, which allows people to appeal against imprisonment without a trial. |
