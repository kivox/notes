# Impact on the UK Constitution

- New Labour (1997-2010)
- Coalition (2010-2015)
- Conservatives (2015-present)

### What have been the most significant changes to the constitution?
- Scotland Act 2016 - Tax Raising Powers
- Wales Act 2017 - Enshrined Welsh Parliament (Senedd)

### Debates on further reform, is more reform needed?
- Devolution
	- Has modified the UK's heavily centralised constitution. Helped to end violence in NI.
	- Scottish independence still an issue. The devolution settlement is uneven.
- Electoral Reform
	- More proportional results achieving in Scotland, Wales, NI and London Assembly
	- FTP remains for Westminster elections and leads to under-representation of smaller parties
- House of Lords
	- Upper chamber based on merit and experience, not career politicians.
	- The lords lack a legitimacy and is highly unusual in the modern age.
- HRA
	- UK brought into line with other EU states.
	- Can be overturned/modified by Parliament/Governments.

- There is a lack of agreement on the form any further change would take
- The current settlement is incomplete and illogical.
