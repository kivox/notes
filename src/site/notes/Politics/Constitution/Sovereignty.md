- # Sovereignty
	- Types:
		- Legal
			- Unrestricted legal authority, based in Parliament
		- Political
			- Unchallenged political power, exercised by the people at election time (only temporary)
	- Limits to parliamentary sovereignty:
		- Is Parliament Sovereign?
			- Could it really take power away from SP or WA?
			- EU Membership had eroded sovereignty as EU law took precedence
			- Greater use of referendums and the elections of new legislative bodies has reduced power of parliament
			- Pressure Groups/NATO/EU/Multi-national corporations erode parliament sovereignty - governments can't act as they like
		- ***BUT**
			- Parliament remains sovereign as it repealed the 1972 European Communities Act - Brexit
			- However it can't legislate to repeal against the powers of multinational corporations
