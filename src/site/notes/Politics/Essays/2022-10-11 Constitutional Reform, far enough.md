# Evaluate the view that constitutional reform in the UK has not gone far enough

> You must consider this view and the alternative view in a balanced way. (30 marks)

### AO3:
- Labour View = Job Done! Devolution, FOI examples of success.
- Tory View = Labour created Constitutional vandalism
- Lib Dem View = Constitutional reform in 1997 too timid. Voting system and HoL reform needed.
