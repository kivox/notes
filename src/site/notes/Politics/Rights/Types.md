- # What are rights?
	- ***Human Rights***, based on a more view of what human beings deserve.
		- Universal
		- Fundamental (these rights are inalienable and cannot be removed)
		- Absolute - they must be present in order for someone to live a genuinely human life
	- ***Civil Liberties**
	- ***Types***
		- ***Negative rights*** - everything not expressly forbidden belongs to our rights.
		- ***Positive rights*** oblige people to provide goods, services or action
		- As the UK has no codified constitution, citizens' rights are determined and protected by:
			- Constitutionally significant events, e.g. Magna Carta.
			- Common Law cases which establish rights and precedents
			- Specific acts of parliament
			- what are the problems with this approach?
				- Open to bias
