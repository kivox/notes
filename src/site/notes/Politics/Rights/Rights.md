# Rights
> Rights areÂ **legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement**; that is, rights are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people according to some legal system, social convention, or ethical theory.
>
> There are two types of rights, positive and negative rights. Positive Right (Oblige people to provide goods, services and action). Negative Rights (everything not expressly forbidden belongs to our rights).

- # What are rights?
	- ***Human Rights***, based on a more view of what human beings deserve.
		- Universal
		- Fundamental (these rights are inalienable and cannot be removed)
		- Absolute - they must be present in order for someone to live a genuinely human life
	- ***Civil Liberties**
	- ***Types***
		- ***Negative rights*** - everything not expressly forbidden belongs to our rights.
		- ***Positive rights*** oblige people to provide goods, services or action
		- As the UK has no codified constitution, citizens' rights are determined and protected by:
			- Constitutionally significant events, e.g. Magna Carta.
			- Common Law cases which establish rights and precedents
			- Specific acts of parliament
			- what are the problems with this approach?
				- Open to bias

# The Development of Rights and Civil Liberties

- ### Timeline
	- 1215 - Magna Carta
		- King John signed Magna Carta. This was an attempt by English nobles to limit the King's power, stating that he was subject to the rule of law. It also confirmed the right to trial by jury and freedom from imprisonment without just cause.
	- 1689 - The Bill of Rights
		- The Bill of Rights introduced by Parliament limited the powers of the monarchy and established parliament's supremacy. It called for free parliamentary elections 'to be held frequently' and freedom of speech within parliament, as well as stating that 'no cruel and unusual punishments \[were to be\] inflicted' upon the people of England
	- 1918 - the Representation of the People Act
		- The representation of the People Act extended the right to vote, and thereby freedom of expression, to all men over the age of 21 and propertied women over 30. The Second RPA in 1928 made suffrage over the age of 21 universal.
	- 1948 - UN Declaration of Human Rights
		- In response to the atrocities of WWII, the 1948 UN Declaration of Human Rights established a list of fundamental human rights that would be upheld by UN members.
	- 1950 - The European Convention on Human Rights
		- The European Convention on Human rights formed a binding international agreement. Signatories undertake to protect rights and freedoms within their own countries.
	- 1998 - The UK Human Rights Act
		- The UK Human Rights Act made rights from the European Convention on Human Rights enforceable in UK court. This made it unnecessary to take cases to the European Court of Human Rights, which could be a long and expensive process
	- 2000 - The Freedom of Information Act 
		- The Freedom of Information Act provides members of the public with a right to request access to information held by public authorities or by persons providing services for them.
	- 2010 - The Equality Act
		- The Equality Act prohibits discrimination, harassment and victimization in relation to gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex and sexual orientation.
