# The Development of Rights and Civil Liberties

- ### Timeline
	- 1215 - Magna Carta
		- King John signed Magna Carta. This was an attempt by English nobles to limit the King's power, stating that he was subject to the rule of law. It also confirmed the right to trial by jury and freedom from imprisonment without just cause.
	- 1689 - The Bill of Rights
		- The Bill of Rights introduced by Parliament limited the powers of the monarchy and established parliament's supremacy. It called for free parliamentary elections 'to be held frequently' and freedom of speech within parliament, as well as stating that 'no cruel and unusual punishments \[were to be\] inflicted' upon the people of England
	- 1918 - the Representation of the People Act
		- The representation of the People Act extended the right to vote, and thereby freedom of expression, to all men over the age of 21 and propertied women over 30. The Second RPA in 1928 made suffrage over the age of 21 universal.
