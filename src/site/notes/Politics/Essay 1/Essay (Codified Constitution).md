Using the source, evaluate the view that the UK's constitution requires major change.

In your response you must:
- compare and contrast different opinions in the source
- examine and debate these views in a baanced way
- analyse and evaluate **only** the information presented in the source

### Introduction
A constitution is a set of fundamental rules and principles established that regulate the relationship between government bodies. Every country has a constitution of some sort that outlines a government's structure.  The difference between a codified and a uncodified constitution is that one is complete and the other one isn't, or in better words, a codified constitution is where the constitution is a written document which has been consolidated into a single document and formally adopted. On the other hand an uncodified constitution can be written down but it is not contained in a single document. This makes it easier to ammend uncodified constitutions.

### For Codification (3 Paragraphs)
One advantage of a codified constitution is the fact that human rights and other fundamental rights would be entrenched. Entrentched means the will be firmly estabilshed and very difficult to change, without entrenchment, it is very easy for a government to make constitutional change with a simple majority vote, this raises the issue of them being able to strip fundamental rights. This is often used as the main argument for a codified constitution, because it is one that is most complete, there is nothing realistically stopping our government from changing the constitution.

Another possible advantage of a codified constitution is that it would make make rights and powers clearer for citizens and legislators. The British constitution is complex and not designed we now have many layers of government on a national and devolved level and dependence on conventions. This can lead to instability and confusion among the british people. Currently, the british constitution is very flexible and isnâ€™t in one central place, whereas countries like the US that have a codified constitution, all of their constitution is collected in one pack of documents.

A codified constitution would limit the powers of parliament further, this means that parliament would not have the ability to change the rights of the citizens just to pass another law, an example of this is the recent event where the UK tried stripping human rights after the UK left the EU. A written constitution would effectively end the principle of parliamentary sovereignty

### Against Codification (3 Paragraphs)
One reason against codification is the fact that it would be needlessly difficult, this links to the infamous argument "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". Another reason it would be very difficult to codify is the fact that much of the UK's constitution is written into our laws. This means rewriting and repetition which could cause a overlap of information if officially codified. Aside from the overlap it could also strip people off their current rights as it will be more and would be easier to refer to certain laws.

Another reason against codification of the UK Constituon is the fact that our rights have been respected and updated by polititians and protected by an independent judiciary. This means that our rights are protected despite them not being codified. 

While limiting the powers of parliament's actions over elements like the human rights, it would also be nearly impossible to ammend a codified constitution with essential information. We cannot predict all problems that might come with a non-flexible constitution constitution. 

### Compare both sides
While a codified constitution would make rights and power clearer, it would also strip some basic rights due to the overlap of information from many sources, in the UK's scenario the constitution is not perfect but it is also not broken, the rights of the people are protected by both polititians and Judiciary. Codifying the constitution would also be very challenging, as some of the constitution is compile with our laws and some of the constitution is contained in standalone documents.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the UK should not have a codified constitution as there are not many advantages to it. Codifing the UK constitution could if anything cause more problems, by stripping away some of the current laws the citizens hold. Aswell as stripping parliament from the ability to address problems that may arise with the codified constitution. Humans don't currently have the ability to predict what issues might occur in future with the newly codified constitution.
