# Improving Electoral Participation

- ## How to improve electoral participation
	- Online Voting
		- The biggest reason why people don't vote is because they can't be bothered or they're lazy to go to a voting booth. This can be fixed by giving them the power to vote from anywhere. People already use their devices often. A couple more clicks that only take a minute or so won't affect their day to day life as much.
	
	- Worldwide Voting
		- Allowing citizens of a country that are abroad to vote. This again links back to online voting, the ease of use is a major factor, this is especially true when you look at studies that suggest our attention span is getting worse by the year.
	
	- Promote Voting
		- This has already been done, but it should be done to a greater extent. And in a more personal manner as that would encourage people and make them more inclined to believe their vote is heard.
	
	- Lowering voting age
		- The younger generation is more involved in politics than the older generations.
	
	- Politics is Elitist
		- Remove the stigma that you need a lot of information to vote
		- Seperation 
	
	- Compulsary voting
		- Tarrifs if you don't vote
			- Your voice must be heard or you'd get fined
		- Australia's voter turnout has been rising year after year, their last voter turnout was over 90%
	
	- Longer voting period
		- If they can't vote at one day 
	
	- Educate children about politics
		- Give kids an idea and understanding of how our democracy works, what the options are, and what the views of both parties are.

> Overall, the best way to increase voter turnout is to move to online based voting. The only downsides to this is security and identity fraud, but that's always been an issue no matter what, if we can manage our entire government life online, we'd sure be able to manage a little form submission.

> Another reason this would help greatly is, there wouldn't be a need to spend as much money on counting votes, a computer is much much much faster than even some of the most intellegent humans alive.
