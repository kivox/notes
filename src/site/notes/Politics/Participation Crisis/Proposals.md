# Proposals

- ## Proposals:
	- ### Referendums
		- ##### Summary:
			- A referendum is a vote, held on a specific issue. Normally this would relate to particular circumstances such as amending the constitution of a country, or to a political issue, such as membership of a political body like the EU, or in relation to any major political issue that is of great importance to society. In the UK, referendums are called whenever Parliament wants to, unlike in countries like Switzerland where they're called whenever there is a change to the constitution or similar.
			- The UK should hold more referendums to let the people decide major changes, such as leaving the EU.
		- ##### Advantages:
			- The people's voice matters more
			- The people actually get a say instead of MPs deciding on their behalf.
				- MPs don't always know what their people want.
			- Similar to Switzerland, we should require a certain amount of signatures on an issue for it to be brought to parliament and then if a change is considered major it shouldn't be left up to the MPs to decide but more the people.
			- Referendums are most successful where they are used to providing legitimacy to a key decision
				- Less disinformation
		- ##### Disadvantages:
			- Emergency legislation would take longer to be put in place.
			- Slower decision-making, stunting the growth and development of a nation
			- Governments only call referendums they're confident of winning.
				- Some sources against this:
					- Government backed remain during the 2016 EU Referendum
	- ### Initiatives
		- ##### Summary:
			- Initiatives are not currently used in the UK but are used in other democracies such as Switzerland and certain states in the USA
			- Initiatives allow people to propose a new law or constitutional amendment by gathering the required amount of signatures
		- ##### Advantages:
			- Allows the people to put new laws in place 
			- More democratic, listens to the people
			- People's views are accurately represented
		- ##### Disadvantages:
			-
