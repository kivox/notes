## The December Election
- Johnson's 80-seat majority rested on just 43.6% of the national vote share
- Between them, Labor and the Conservatives secured. 76% of the vote share.
- **Why might figures like this discourage participation?**
	- They might believe their vote isn't as powerful
	- Lower numbers might discourage some participation
	- Majority with 43.6%, a vote wouldn't matter
	- Voting for green wouldn't make a difference, so green voters vote labor
		- This is because our country, is practically a 2 party nation. Labour and Conservatives
