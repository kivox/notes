- ## Major referendums since 1997
	- **11 September 1997:** Scotland – Scottish devolution referendums on whether there should be a Scottish Parliament and whether the Scottish Parliament should have tax varying powers (both referendums received a yes vote of 74% and 64% respectively. Turnout 60%)

- ### For:
	- Lets the people have a say
	- 

- ### Against:
	- With low voter turnout, it is not democratic, as only those who wanted involvement voted.
	- Makes decision making slower, waiting on electorate to vote.
	- Decision can be swayed, due to the excessive spread of social media
