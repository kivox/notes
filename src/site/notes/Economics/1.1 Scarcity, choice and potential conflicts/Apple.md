# Apple and Stakeholders

## Using the Evidence provided, DISCUSS the extents to which Apple is prioritizing shareholders over another stakeholder group of your choice.

- ## Evidence Used:
	- Evidence A: Happy Customers at Apple
	- Evidence B: Staffing at Apple Stores
	- Evidence D: Apple in China

The evidence presented suggests that apple does try to prioritize its shareholders over its employees and customers in many ways. In both sources, evidence b and d, it is suggested that apple cares about the working conditions of its employees, in source b.

Evidence B suggests that when Apple was first founded, Ron Johnson was appointed to `reinvent retail`. They wanted to strive for customer satisfaction, so they would want to make their employees as motivated as possible, they tried to optimize their genius bars not only to workers but to consumers too, this is then further backed up to show that this method worked as their sales presented in Evidence A.

However, by the looks of things it isn't all sunshine and rainbows, workers have attempted and some successfully committed suicide in the Foxconn plants. There was an agreement to stop this which led to nothing as it seems as another suicide happened after their agreement. This suggests that apple is more profit focused rather than working environment.

Overall, Apple does try to balance the working environment and the profit to shareholders, but sometimes it seems they add too much weight to one side of the scale, making the scale unbalanced. This is not always a good thing, but sometimes it seems like it is very useful. Despite all this, their sales have always kept on growing. This shows that, despite wanting shareholders happy, Apple also wants their customers happy.
