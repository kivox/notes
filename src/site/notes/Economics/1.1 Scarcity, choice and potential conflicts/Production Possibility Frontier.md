# Production Possibility Frontier

- The production possibility frontier shows the maximum output combinations of two goods in an economy when:
	- all resources are fully employed; and
	- given the current state of technology

## Fishing and Agriculture Colleration
- We normally draw a PPF as concave to the origin i.e. when we move down along the PPF, as more resources are allocated towards Good Y the extra output gets smaller

- This is explained by the law of diminishing marginal returns, it occurs because not all factor inputs are equally suited to producing items leading to lower productivity

- Land, labour and capital are imperfect substitutes

- Moving from points A to B means

- We are forgoing 10 units of fish in exchange for 50 units of agricultural output

- So the OC ratio = - **0.2 fish** **:** 1 agriculture**
