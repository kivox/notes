# Market Supply
> Market supply is total supply brought to the market by producers at each price. To calculate, sum the individual supply schedules.
- Supply is the quantity of a good or service that a producer is willing and able to supply onto the market at a given price in a given time period.
- The basic law of supply is that as the price of a product rises, so businesses expand supply to the market.
- A supply curve shows a relationship between market price and how much a firm is willing and able to sell.

# Law of Supply
There are three main reasons why supply curves are drawn as
sloping upwards from left to right:

- ### The profit motive:
	- If the market price rises following an increase in demand, it becomes more profitable for businesses to increase their output
- ### Production and costs:
	- When output expands, a firm’s production costs tend to rise, therefore a higher price is needed to cover these extra costs of production. This may be due to the effects of diminishing returns as more factor inputs are added to production.
- ### New entrants coming into the market:
	- Higher prices may create an incentive for other businesses to enter a market leading to an increase in total supply.
