# Causes of Shifts
1. Changes in the unit costs of production
	- Lower unit costs mean that a business can supply more at each price – for example higher productivity
	- Higher unit costs cause an inward shift of supply e.g. a rise in wage rates or an increase in energy prices / other raw materials
2. A fall (depreciation) in the exchange rate causes an increase in prices of imported components and raw materials
3. Advances in production technologies – outward shift of supply
4. The entry of new producers into the market – outward shift
5. Favourable weather conditions e.g. for agricultural products
6. Taxes, subsidies and government regulations
	- Indirect taxes cause an inward shift of supply
	- Subsidies cause an outward shift of supply
	- Regulations increase costs – causing an inward shift of supply
