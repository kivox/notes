# Law of Supply
There are three main reasons why supply curves are drawn as
sloping upwards from left to right:

- ### The profit motive:
	- If the market price rises following an increase in demand, it becomes more profitable for businesses to increase their output
- ### Production and costs:
	- When output expands, a firmâ€™s production costs tend to rise, therefore a higher price is needed to cover these extra costs of production. This may be due to the effects of diminishing returns as more factor inputs are added to production.
- ### New entrants coming into the market:
	- Higher prices may create an incentive for other businesses to enter a market leading to an increase in total supply.
