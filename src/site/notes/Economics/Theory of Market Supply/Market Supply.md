# Market Supply
> Market supply is total supply brought to the market by producers at each price. To calculate, sum the individual supply schedules.
- Supply is the quantity of a good or service that a producer is willing and able to supply onto the market at a given price in a given time period.
- The basic law of supply is that as the price of a product rises, so businesses expand supply to the market.
- A supply curve shows a relationship between market price and how much a firm is willing and able to sell.
