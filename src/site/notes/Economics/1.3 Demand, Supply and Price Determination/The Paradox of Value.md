# The Paradox of Value

> The paradox of value is the contradiction that, although water is on the whole more useful, in terms of survival, than diamonds, diamonds command a higher price in the market.

- Choices will depend on the situation.

- If you're in a desert, and you had the choice between a diamond and water, you'd choose water, but in a game show you'd choose the diamond.

- Consider opportunity cost - what we lose if you chose one.

- Marginal opportunity - Once you have water, you'll choose diamonds.

##### Consumer Objectives:
- Maximise utility
- Avoid diminishing returns.
