# Limitations of CPI
- CPI is not fully representative of everybody. For a ‘non-typical’ household, then average prices will be different. For example, 14% of the CPI index is devoted to motoring costs.
- Spending patterns vary between household types – single, students, families and the elderly.
- Although price may rise, this may also be accompanied by improvements in the quality – which is not factored in.
- Consumer trends are dynamic and a new, popular good may not yet be counted and suddenly unpopular goods are counted.
- The reality is that when certain goods become significantly more expensive, many consumers find less-expensive alternatives to them. For instance, buying the store brand instead of the name brand, or buying regular gasoline instead of premium grade. CPI instead presents numbers that go on assuming consumers are continuing to buy the same amount of increasingly expensive goods.
