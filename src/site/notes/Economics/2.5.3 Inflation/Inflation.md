# Inflation

### Keyterms:
- Inflation - Increase in the average prices across the economy. Compared with the previous 12 months
- Disinflation - The level of inflation is falling - meaning that prices are rising, but rising more slowly
- Deflation - Average prices are actually falling. Compared with the previous 12 months.
- Stagflation - Inflation is high (above the 1-3% target) and economic growth is low
- Hyperinflation - Inflation is rising rapidly, this is >50% by definition (Weimar Republic, Zimbabwe and Venezuela)
- Shrinkflation - As costs rise instead of increasing the price, firms are reducing the size of goods.
- Disdeflation: Deflation is falling, meaning that prices are falling but falling more slowly.
- Unit labour costs - Reflect total labour costs, including social security and employers’ pension contributions, and including the costs of self-employed labour, incurred in the product on of a unit of economic output.

### Specification:
- Inflation, deflation and disinflation
- Interpret price indices (RPI and CPI) and the rate of inflation
- Real nominal values, constant and current prices
- Causes of inflation
	- Demand pull
	- Cost push
- The impact of inflation on firms:
	- Uncertainty
	- Loss of international competitiveness
- The impact of inflation on individuals:
	- Loss of real income
	- Savers and Borrowers

# Index Numbers
- Economists use index numbes to compare data over time
- Index numbers always give a _**base year**_ and all toehr data is in comparison to this base year - which is represented by the value 100.

### Example
- Assuming 2020 is the base year. Everything is comparable to the base
	- 2019 - £400,000 - 80%
	- 2020 - £500,000 - 100%
	- 2021 - £550,000 - 110%
	- 2022 - £1,000,000 - 200%

# What are the Main Causes of Inflation?
- Demand Pull Inflation
	- Caused by excess aggregate demand
	- Often linked to a money and credit boom
	- Economy close to full capcity (inelastic AS)
	- Positive output gap (AD >potential GDP)
- Cost Push Inflation
	- Rising wage costs in labour
- Administered Prices
	- Changes in regulated prices e.g water bills
	- Changes in indirect taxes and subsidies
	- Changes in environmental taxes

### Causes of inflation, in detail:
- Cost-push inflation
	- Inflation may be initiated on the supply side of the macroeconomy, arising from an increase in the costs faced by firms – this could be as a result of oil prices increasing or wage costs going up. Remember, to represent this diagrammatically you would only draw a SRAS, as increases in costs of production do not shift LRAS.
- Demand-pull Inflation:
	- Increases in price level initiated by an increase in aggregate demand, which can be caused by an increase in any of the components of aggregate demand.

# Why is it desirable/important for the economy to have low inflation?
1. **International Competitiveness**: High inflation would mean that UK goods/services are becoming more expensive (relative to other countries) and therefore less competitive, this would cause a fall in demand for UK goods and so the current account balance will deteriorate, exporting firms may lay workers off leading to an increase in unemployment and a fall in economic growth.
2. **Business Confidence**: A stable economy means firms can invest more as it is easier to predict the price of their good/services in the future, so it is easier to predict future sales and so investment increases. Increased investment is important for economic growth e.g. increases in real GDP and UK firms will become more competitive with innovative products/processes. Innovative processes can lead to a fall in average costs. (Investment may also take the form of increasing human capital e.g. training and education which boosts productivity).
3. **Interest Rates**: Low inflation may mean that the Bank of England can lower interest rates to stimulate the economy if they need to - lower interest rates will encourage consumption, investment, and they will also make the value of the pound lower which makes UK exports cheaper and imports to the UK are more expensive.
4. **Menu Costs**: If prices increase rapidly, then firms have to keep amending their price lists – printing labels, altering computer systems. These increase costs of production and are known as menu costs.
5. **Distorts normal economic behaviour**: Very high inflation discourages people from holding money, because if the average price level of goods/services in the economy keeps increasing, the value of money is eroded. This leads to people putting all of their money into bank accounts, where they can at least gain some interest to combat inflation. When this happens consumption grinds to a halt.
6. **Income in real terms**: The impact of inflation can be worsened if wages and pensions fail to increase at the same time, meaning that people will received a pay cut in real terms - which will cause a reduction in consumption. If taxes do not keep up with inflation, then the value of the government’s tax revenue will fall – as everything that the government has to pay for also increases; at which point, the government may start to physically print money to resolve the situation – increasing inflation even further!
7. **Wage price spiral**: With higher inflation, workers see their real incomes fall and so bid for higher wages from their employers. This in turn leads to higher costs (cost push inflation) and further spending (demand-pull).

# How is inflation measured?
> Inflation is measured by comparing the price of a basket of goods and comparing it year-on-year. The basket is updated in line with consumer trends, with more popular goods being added and less popular goods being removed each year. There are two main measures used by economists: CPI and RPI inflation.

- ##### Consumer Price Index (CPI) 
	- This is the most important measure of general prices in the UK – it is what the government and Bank of England uses to assess the 2% target against. This measure is based on the prices of a basket of popular goods and services.
	- 180,000 prices for around 720 goods and services in a basket.

- ##### Retail Price Index (RPI)/(CPIH)
	- Uses the same goods in the basket of goods as CPI, but in addition it includes housing costs (mortgage interest and council tax). Therefore, this figure tends to be higher than the CPI rate.

> There are more measures, such as CPIH, RPIX, RPIY but they are not in the specification.

# Limitations of CPI
- CPI is not fully representative of everybody. For a ‘non-typical’ household, then average prices will be different. For example, 14% of the CPI index is devoted to motoring costs.
- Spending patterns vary between household types – single, students, families and the elderly.
- Although price may rise, this may also be accompanied by improvements in the quality – which is not factored in.
- Consumer trends are dynamic and a new, popular good may not yet be counted and suddenly unpopular goods are counted.
- The reality is that when certain goods become significantly more expensive, many consumers find less-expensive alternatives to them. For instance, buying the store brand instead of the name brand, or buying regular gasoline instead of premium grade. CPI instead presents numbers that go on assuming consumers are continuing to buy the same amount of increasingly expensive goods.
