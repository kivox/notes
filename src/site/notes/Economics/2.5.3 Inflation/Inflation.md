# Inflation

### Keyterms:
- Inflation - Increase in the average prices across the economy. Compared with the previous 12 months
- Disinflation - The level of inflation is falling - meaning that prices are rising, but rising more slowly
- Deflation - Average prices are actually falling. Compared with the previous 12 months.
- Stagflation - Inflation is high (above the 1-3% target) and economic growth is low
- Hyperinflation - Inflation is rising rapidly, this is >50% by definition (Weimar Republic, Zimbabwe and Venezuela)
- Shrinkflation - As costs rise instead of increasing the price, firms are reducing the size of goods.
- Disdeflation: Deflation is falling, meaning that prices are falling but falling more slowly.
- Unit labour costs - Reflect total labour costs, including social security and employers’ pension contributions, and including the costs of self-employed labour, incurred in the product on of a unit of economic output.

### Specification:

# Index Numbers
- Economists use index numbes to compare data over time
- Index numbers always give a _**base year**_ and all toehr data is in comparison to this base year - which is represented by the value 100.

### Example
- Assuming 2020 is the base year. Everything is comparable to the base
	- 2019 - £400,000 - 80%
	- 2020 - £500,000 - 100%
	- 2021 - £550,000 - 110%
	- 2022 - £1,000,000 - 200%

# What are the Main Causes of Inflation?
- Demand Pull Inflation
	- Caused by excess aggregate demand
	- Often linked to a money and credit boom
	- Economy close to full capcity (inelastic AS)
	- Positive output gap (AD >potential GDP)
- Cost Push Inflation
	- Rising wage costs in labour
- Administered Prices
	- Changes in regulated prices e.g water bills
	- Changes in indirect taxes and subsidies
	- Changes in environmental taxes

# How is inflation measured?
> Inflation is measured by comparing the price of a basket of goods and comparing it year-on-year. The basket is updated in line with consumer trends, with more popular goods being added and less popular goods being removed each year. There are two main measures used by economists: CPI and RPI inflation.

- ##### Consumer Price Index (CPI) 
	- This is the most important measure of general prices in the UK – it is what the government and Bank of England uses to assess the 2% target against. This measure is based on the prices of a basket of popular goods and services.
	- 180,000 prices for around 720 goods and services in a basket.

- ##### Retail Price Index (RPI)/(CPIH)
	- Uses the same goods in the basket of goods as CPI, but in addition it includes housing costs (mortgage interest and council tax). Therefore, this figure tends to be higher than the CPI rate.

> There are more measures, such as CPIH, RPIX, RPIY but they are not in the specification.

# Limitations of CPI
- CPI is not fully representative of everybody. For a ‘non-typical’ household, then average prices will be different. For example, 14% of the CPI index is devoted to motoring costs.
- Spending patterns vary between household types – single, students, families and the elderly.
- Although price may rise, this may also be accompanied by improvements in the quality – which is not factored in.
- Consumer trends are dynamic and a new, popular good may not yet be counted and suddenly unpopular goods are counted.
- The reality is that when certain goods become significantly more expensive, many consumers find less-expensive alternatives to them. For instance, buying the store brand instead of the name brand, or buying regular gasoline instead of premium grade. CPI instead presents numbers that go on assuming consumers are continuing to buy the same amount of increasingly expensive goods.
