# What are the Main Causes of Inflation?
- Demand Pull Inflation
	- Caused by excess aggregate demand
	- Often linked to a money and credit boom
	- Economy close to full capcity (inelastic AS)
	- Positive output gap (AD >potential GDP)
- Cost Push Inflation
	- Rising wage costs in labour
- Administered Prices
	- Changes in regulated prices e.g water bills
	- Changes in indirect taxes and subsidies
	- Changes in environmental taxes

### Causes of inflation, in detail:
- Cost-push inflation
	- Inflation may be initiated on the supply side of the macroeconomy, arising from an increase in the costs faced by firms â€“ this could be as a result of oil prices increasing or wage costs going up. Remember, to represent this diagrammatically you would only draw a SRAS, as increases in costs of production do not shift LRAS.
- Demand-pull Inflation:
	- Increases in price level initiated by an increase in aggregate demand, which can be caused by an increase in any of the components of aggregate demand.
