### Consumer Price Index
>This is the most important measure of general prices in the UK – it is what the government uses to assess the 2% target against. This measure is based on the prices of a bundle of goods and services measured at different points in time – Be careful, CPI is not inflation, because inflation is the rate of change in prices. CPI is measured every month, so if the CPI increases, this would be known as inflation.
