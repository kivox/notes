# How is inflation measured?
> Inflation is measured by comparing the price of a basket of goods and comparing it year-on-year. The basket is updated in line with consumer trends, with more popular goods being added and less popular goods being removed each year. There are two main measures used by economists: CPI and RPI inflation.

- ##### Consumer Price Index (CPI) 
	- This is the most important measure of general prices in the UK â€“ it is what the government and Bank of England uses to assess the 2% target against. This measure is based on the prices of a basket of popular goods and services.
	- 180,000 prices for around 720 goods and services in a basket.

- ##### Retail Price Index (RPI)/(CPIH)
	- Uses the same goods in the basket of goods as CPI, but in addition it includes housing costs (mortgage interest and council tax). Therefore, this figure tends to be higher than the CPI rate.

> There are more measures, such as CPIH, RPIX, RPIY but they are not in the specification.
