# Index Numbers
- Economists use index numbes to compare data over time
- Index numbers always give a _**base year**_ and all toehr data is in comparison to this base year - which is represented by the value 100.

### Example
- Assuming 2020 is the base year. Everything is comparable to the base
	- 2019 - £400,000 - 80%
	- 2020 - £500,000 - 100%
	- 2021 - £550,000 - 110%
	- 2022 - £1,000,000 - 200%
