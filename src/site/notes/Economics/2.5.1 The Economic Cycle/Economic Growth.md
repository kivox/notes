# Economic Growth
We need to distinguish between short-run and long-run economic growth.

## Short-Run
> “The actual annual percentage change in real national output”.

>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - the total value of all goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time

## Long-Run
> “An increase in the potential productive capacity of the economy”.

> The maximum potential output of the economy using all factor resources as illustrated on the Production Possibility Frontier.
