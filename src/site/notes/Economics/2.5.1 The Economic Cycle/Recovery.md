# Recovery

# Recovery
*This occur when real GDP picks up from the trough reached at the low point of the [[Economics/2.5.1 The Economic Cycle/Recession|Recession]]*

- The state of business confidence plays a key role here. Any recovery might be subdued if businesses anticipate that it will be temporary or weak in scale.

- A recovery might follow a deliberate attempt to stimulate demand. In the UK we have seen

- Cuts in interest rates – the policy interest rate fell to 0.5% in the Autumn of 2008 and they have stayed at this low level since 

- A rise in government borrowing

- A policy of quantitative easing (QE) by the Bank of England to pump more money into the banking system in a bid to increase the supply of loans – now worth more than £375 billion.
