# Boom
*A boom occurs when real national output is rising at a rate faster than the trend rate of growth.*

### Some of the characteristics of a boom include:
- A fast growth of **consumption** helped by rising real incomes, strong confidence and a surge in house prices and share prices

- A pick up in **demand for capital goods** as businesses invest in extra capacity to meet strong demand and to make higher profits

- More jobs created and **falling unemployment** and higher real wages

- High **demand for imports** which may cause the economy to run a larger **trade deficit** because it cannot supply all of the goods and services that consumers are buying

- **Government tax revenues** will be rising as people earn and spend more and companies are making larger profits â€“ this gives the government money to increase spending in areas such as education, the environment, health and transport.

- An increase in **inflationary pressures** if the economy overheats and has a positive output gap.
