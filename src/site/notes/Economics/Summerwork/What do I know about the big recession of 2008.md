# What do I know about the big recession of 2008?

### Summary:
> In the mid-2000s, a disparate group of four outsiders in the finance industry noticed something that the banks, media and government all failed to spot: the looming collapse of the U.S. housing market and global economic crisis. Armed with this information, they came up with a plan dubbed ‘The Big Short’, taking on the supposedly infallible institutions, even though nobody took them seriously.
