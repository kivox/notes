# Why Economics?

# Why I've chosen it?
I believe that economics will help me think strategically and make decisions to optimise the outcome of an operation or task. This is especially important and in demand in finances and procuration operations.

# Will I enjoy it?
I very much enjoy things that I can use in practice aswell. My interest is mainly oriented towards linking what I learn to how I can use it in practice, I have several projects that rely on economics to optimise the outcome of changes done to them.
