# Effects
- ### Real Income Effect
	- When prices are low, how does this impact upon the purchasing power of people's income
		- 
	- Again, how do prices impact upon the relative value of people's assets (houses, investments)?
		- 
	- Therefore, from the questions above, what effect does a low overall price level within an economy mean the impact upon consumption would be?
		- 
- ### Interest Rate Effect
	- A second argument relates to the interest rates which (as we shall see later on) tend to be low when prices are low, how would this impact upon consumption?
		- 
	- How would this also impact upon investment?
		- 
- ### Balance of Trade Effect
	- A third argument relates to exports and imports, if price levels were low, how would this impact export?
		- 
	- How would this impact imports?
		- 
	- Therefore, with a low overall price level, how would this impact upon GDP?
	- ##### Summary
		- If prices are low, ceteris paribus, UK prices are more competitive - when compared to other countries.
		- This will mean a larger quantity of exports being sold 
		- But also a fall in the level of imports, as people opt for cheap UK goods.
			- So...lower overall prices within an economy means less of a leakage
