# If America sneezes, The World catches a cold
> This statement refers to how the world will be affected if the US were to suffer a recession.

- If the US suffers a recession, then their citizens will buy fewer exports
	- These imports (withdrawal for US) are an export (injection) for China.
	- In 2019, the US imported $450bn of goods from China.
- Therefore, fewer goods and services being exported to the United States... means lower incomes for Chinese firms and households.
- China purchases raw material from many nations (such as textiles from Vietnam) and so demand for their exports falls...meaning low incomes for Vietnamese workers
- Globalization has resulted in economies being very interconnected.
- The impact on the US would be fewer imports which in turn would lead to less sales for Chinese businesses to export to the US which then means firms have less revenue meaning people could become unemployed meaning they have less disposable income to spend on goods and services.
- The impact on exports would be that
- The impact on government spending would increase due to more people being unemployed and requiring benefits
- Business investment would decrease because market conditions are more uncertain and the business has less revenue
- Taxation would decrease because fewer people are in work and paying taxes
- Savings would increase because consumers have less confidence
