# How IO Devices can help with Disabilities
- ## Devices
	- ### Braille Keyboard:
		- ##### Description:
			- A Braille keyboard is a specialist input device that allows the user to type and enter text or instructions for the computer in Braille.
			- Braille is a writing system for blind and visually impaired people. It is made up of raised dots that can be 'read' by touch. Braille allows blind and partially sighted people to learn spelling, grammar and punctuation and gain an understanding of how text is formatted on the page.
		- ##### How it works:
			- Braille keyboard contain single keys that represent each of the dots in a braille cell. To type a letter in braille, the user would press a combination of the keys needed to create that braille character.
		- ##### Disabilities it helps with:
			- Low Vision
			- Visually Impaired

	- ### Speakers:
		- ##### Description:
			- Speakers are an output device that can be useful for visually impaired and people that find it hard to read text people in terms of text-to-speech systems.
		- ##### How it works:
			- The computer takes sentences and converts them to audio, usually done by AI. This audio is then played back through the speakers to give the user the ability to understand what the text inputted is saying.
		- ##### Disabilities it helps with:
			- Low Vision
			- Visually Impaired

	- ### Microphones:
		- ##### Description:
			- Microphones are input devices that record analogue sound, analogue sound wave must be converted into digital form before the computer is able to process it.
			- Microphones are used for voice recognition in speech-to-text software programs, or speech input in games or televisions, and in biometric security.
		- ##### How it works:
			- Microphones can capture audio that can then be passed onto programs that can convert the audio into text.
		- #### Disabilities it helps with:
			- Hard of hearing
				- By amplifying the sound, people that are hard of hearing can better understand the sound around them.

	- ### Hearing Aids
		- #### Description:
			- Hearing aids are a combination of both input and output devices, they contain a microphone and a speaker, they often amplify sound but sometimes also remove background noise, making everything more understandable to the person wearing them.
		- #### How it works:
			- The microphone takes in sound from the outside, the chip inside the hearing aid amplifies and seperates background noise from speech, then the speaker feedbacks it back into the ear of the user.
		- #### Disabilities it helps with:
			- Autism
				- People with autism tend to have a harder time filtering out background noise, so everything just turns into a jumble of non-understandable mess of noise.
			- Hard of hearing
				- People that are hard of hearing will also find hearing aids very useful as they can be made, so they amplify the sound, this will make everything louder to the person wearing them help them make a better sense of what is being said and what they're hearing.
