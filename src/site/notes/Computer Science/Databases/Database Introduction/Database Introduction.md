# Databases Introduction

>A database is an organised collection of data that can usually be accessed by the use of an API. The most common database type is SQL, this uses the Structured Query Language. No-SQL databases do exist, however one big advantage SQL has over No-SQL is the fact that, SQL supports relations. Relations allow you to reuse data and link multiple records together. An example of a database use is when a user has a login system, once the user logs in they might have relations to projects they hold access to, and then what other members that project holds.
