# Touchscreen

# Touchscreens
- Most modern mobile phones have a touch screen interface. Even satellite navigation and printers have touch screens. 

- There are two types of touch screen, resistive and capacitive, both versions send the X and Y co-ordinates of the touch to the operating system when a touch is registered.

- It works using a grid system, with the screen being split up. The Y-axis increases in value going down rather than up, which is different from what you may be used to in mathematics.

X = 3
Y = 2

# Resistive and Capacitive Touch Screens
- Capacitive touch screens allow for a much sharper image and for multiple touchpoints to be recorded simultaneously, making them superior to, and more expensive than, resistive touch screens. 

- Capacitive touch screens make use of the fact that the human body can conduct electricity; when you touch a capacitive screen, you change the electric field of the area you touched. 

- This change in field registers as a click and sends the X and Y co-ordinates back to the OS. 

- One downside, apart from the expense, is that you cannot make use of a capacitive screen when wearing gloves or using items such as a pen, as they do not conduct electricity.
